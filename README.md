ColorPalette is an intentionally flawed React project designed
to generate random color palettes, and your task is to identify
and correct the intentional mistakes in order to enable users
to save and view their favorite color combinations.

Mistake 1: Missing import React statement.
In React components, you need to import React when using JSX syntax.

Mistake 2: Typo in component name.
The component name should be ColorPalette, but it's misspelled as ColorPalatte.

Mistake 3: Reusing the same key for mapped elements.
When using map() to generate elements, each element should have a unique key prop.

Mistake 4: onClick handler on color swatches.
The savePalette function is attached to each color swatch, but it should only be triggered by the "Save Palette" button.

Mistake 5: Incorrect attribute name in SavedPalettes component.
The SavedPaltette.js file has a typo in the attribute name, which should be savedPalettes instead of savedPalette.

Mistake 6: Missing event handler in Generate New Palette button.
The "Generate New Palette" button should have an onClick event handler to call the generateNewPalette function.

Mistake 7: Using the wrong variable for saving the new palette.
When generating a new palette, the colors should be stored using setColors, not setSavedPalettes.

Mistake 8: Reusing the same index as the key in SavedPalettes.
When mapping saved palettes, use a unique identifier (e.g., the index of the palette) as the key.
